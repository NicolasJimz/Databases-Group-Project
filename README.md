# Databases-Group-Project
Group project for databases course at the University of North Georgia.
Changes will need to be made to the 'ConnectDB.java' class to get the program working, lines 12-15.
This program works in conjunction with MySQL Workbench.
The 'movie-cast.txt' and 'movie-name-score.txt' files are the CSV files given to us to work with for this project.
The program will use these files and automatically create the tables in MySQL for you, you only need to provide the path to the files and click the insert button.
